generalPE:
In the generalPE package, should there be two overloaded methods for checking if an
integer is a prime number? Is it slower to calculate isPrime( long ) rather than
isPrime( int ) when passing an int argument? If it is not slower, then we do not need to
keep the isPrime( int ) method. Is it just a memory consideration or is it also
inefficient with respect to CPU usage?

Is the algorithm for testing whether an integer is prime the most efficient available?
Will there be much benefit of using a more efficient algorithm?
