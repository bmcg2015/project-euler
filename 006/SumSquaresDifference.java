/**
* Problem description:
* Problem 6:
* The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
* 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
* The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
* (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
* Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
* and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
* Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural
* numbers and the square of the sum.
